# Quantum Playground

Interactive quantum circuit sandbox with a lightweight statevector simulator, seeded measurement sampling, and shareable permalinks.

## Tech
- Next.js (App Router)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS

## Local dev

```bash
nvm use
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Scripts
- `npm run dev`
- `npm run build`
- `npm run lint`
- `npm test`

## Notes
This MVP focuses on correctness and clarity over scale. Statevector simulation is capped in the UI to keep performance predictable.
